# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: September 19, 2025_

We understand the importance of your privacy and personal data. We are committed to protecting your information and being transparent about how we collect and use your data through our application, Class Search (the "App").

## Information We Collect

In general we do not collect any personal information. All interaction you have with the application occurs locally on your device. For any internet requests made by application it is directly between your device and your institution's servers or third-party services (e.g., Rate My Professor, PolyRatings). None of this data is ever sent and collected to our servers.

## Usage of Cookies and Session Data

Session storage is provided by your institution's servers \(e.g. CSU PeopleSoft\) and is used to maintain your authenticated session while using the app. This authentication data is stored locally in session storage, state managed by your institution, and destroyed when you close the application. For that reason you will need to reauthenticate each time you open the application.

For third-party services such as Rate My Professor and PolyRatings, we use a generic session token to anonymously access their public APIs. This token is not tied to any personal information and is used solely to fetch data from these services.

## Third-Party Services

We may use third-party services \(ie. Rate My Professor, PolyRatings\) to enhance the functionality of our app. These services may collect data as described in their respective privacy policies. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party services to understand how they handle your data.

## Data Security

We take data security seriously and understand the importance of protecting your information. All data is stored and processed locally on your device. Most data is destroyed when you close the application. However, some data such as your search history and preferences may be stored locally on your device to enhance your user experience. We recommend keeping your device secure by practicing good security hygiene such as using strong passwords and keeping your software up to date.

## Deletion of Data

You can delete any locally stored data such as your search history and preferences by navigating to the [settings page](./settings.md) within the application and selecting the option to clear your data under `Cache Settings`.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the updated policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this document.
