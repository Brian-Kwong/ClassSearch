Class search is a interactive desktop application that empowers you to search for classes at your university. It uses the same backend API as your institution allowing for up-to date information on offered courses and live seat availability. With advanced filtering options, you can easily find classes that fit your schedule and take the stress out of registration.

Learn more about the application in the [Getting Started](./docs/getting-started.md) guide.
